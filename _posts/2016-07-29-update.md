Tasks Completed Today

- [x] Running / Exercising
- [x] Read Something
- [x] Study some Deep Learning
- [x] Do Some coding

# Running / Exercising
Today I ran `1.2Km in total`. 1.2Km warm-up run and then did the [plank exercise][plank-exercise]. I also went for the run in the evening. Although, I don't prefer running in the evening, its not too bad either. Better than not running at all.

# Reading
Today I completed reading sections 5 to 10 of the Statistics book _Bayesian Inference by O'hagan and Forster_.

# Study Some Deep Learning
Couldn't make much progress in this front today. I just created the graphical model as a part of task 3 [discussed a few days back](../26/update.html#study-some-deep-learning). The next task is to derive the lower bound equations. 

# Coding.
I finished all 5 sections of the [angular js][angular-js] course. There is a follow up course also, I plan to work on that next. 


# Miscellaneous
- TODO  
    *  Read chapter 8 - _Graphical Models_ of PRML as suggested by **JK**

---------------- 

# Tentative Plan for Tomorrow
- Derive the equations of the lower bound in Deep Learning.
- Start the new [angular-js course][angular-course].
- Read subsections 10 to 15 of chapter 3 in Baysian Inference Book. 
- Run for 2.6Km

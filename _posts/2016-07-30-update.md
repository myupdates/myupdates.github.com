Tasks Completed Today

- [x] Running / Exercising
- [x] Read Something
- [x] Study some Deep Learning
- [x] Do Some coding

# Running / Exercising
Today I ran `2.6Km in total`. 2.4Km warm-up run and then 2x100m fast runs. Then I did the [plank exercise][plank-exercise] 3 x 1minute.I did this in the morning. 

# Reading
Today I completed reading sections 10 to 15 of the Statistics book _Bayesian Inference by O'hagan and Forster_.

# Study Some Deep Learning
I did not make much progress today also. I just read 1 section of the chapter suggested by **JK** as written in [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous) below.

# Coding.
I started the first section of the new [angular js][angular-js] course. Now I feel I should put to practice what I have learnt before I start learning something new. So, that's what I will do tomorrow. Implement parts of what I have learnt into my portfolio website.


# Miscellaneous
- TODO  
    *  Read chapter 8 - _Graphical Models_ of PRML as suggested by **JK**

---------------- 

# Tentative Plan for Tomorrow
- Derive the equations of the lower bound in Deep Learning.
- Work on my portfolio website. This is how it looks now. ![Screenshot](/static/homepage1.png) The plan next is to add some more content to it and then utilize the Angular.js I have learnt to make the site's code a bit more organized.
- Read subsections 15 to 20 of chapter 3 in Baysian Inference Book. 
- Run for 2.8Km

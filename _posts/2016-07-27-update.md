Tasks Completed Today

- [x] Running / Exercising
- [x] Read Something
- [x] Study some Deep Learning
- [x] Do Some coding

# Running / Exercising
Today I ran `2Km in total`. 1.6Km warm-up run and then 4x100m fast run.

# Reading
Today I completed 2 exercise questions from the second chapter of the book reading course taught by **AV**.
A brief description of the course is in the next section.

The course is about reading all 15 chapters of this book and solve selected (by **AV**) exercises. At the moment, 4 of us (SK, SS, MP and Me) are working on the course. We are expected to have a meeting after finishing reading each chapter of the book. In the meeting we discuss any concepts we found hard to understand, doubts which need clarification from  **AV** etc. All of these details go into a learning diary (a google doc) which is submitted at the end of the course to **AV**

# Study Some Deep Learning
Following the meeting I had with **JK** yesterday, I started working on the derivations (1 and 2 below). However, I couldn't make much progress because I spent a lot of time trying to understand a topic we had discussed during my meeting with **JK**.

So, I will start working on the derivations of the following tomorrow:

1. Go over the **ADGM** paper (The one written by **C** guys) and re-derive part of the equations with a small change.
2. In addition to the changes made in step 1. now make additional changes so that, the [graphical model][graphical-model] looks like the one from the `SS DGM` paper.

# Coding.

I started doing an online course of another web-application development framework called [angular js][angular-js]. This will allow me to create simple (I don't intend to spend much time learning this apart from this course, so my expertise with this tool will be limitted.) web applications like my portfolio website and possibly a re-write of this updates page. I completed 2.5 out of the 5 modules of the [course][angular-course].


---------------- 

# Tentative Plan for Tomorrow
- Do the two DL derivations.
- Finish 1 more section of the [angular-js course][angular-course].
- Read 5 subsections of chapter 3 in Baysian Inference Book. 
- Run for 2.2Km
